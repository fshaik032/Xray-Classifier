          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>My name is Faaris Shaik, and Iâ€™m currently a Computer Science student at the University of Illinois. According to the Center of Disease Control, there are approximately 1.5 million visits to the emergency room for pneumonia in the US annually. With Pneumonia being a possible symptom of COVID-19, that figure has undoubtedly increased. I decided to build this web app to help alleviate the burden doctors are currently facing with infected patients. The machine learning model the website uses to classify was made using a dataset from Kaggle and it currently has an accuracy of 86%.</p>
