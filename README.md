According to the Center of Disease Control, there are approximately 1.5 million visits to the emergency room for pneumonia in the US annually. With Pneumonia being a possible symptom of COVID-19, that figure has undoubtedly increased. I decided to build this web app to help alleviate the burden doctors are currently facing with infected patients. I made this website using Flask and the model using Tensorflow. The machine learning model the website uses to classify was made using a dataset from Kaggle and it currently has an accuracy of 86%. The depolyed site can be found at https://pneumonia-detector-fs.herokuapp.com
