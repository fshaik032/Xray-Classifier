# Xray-Classifier
According to the Center of Disease Control, there are approximately 1.5 million visits to the emergency room for pneumonia in the US annually. With Pneumonia being a possible symptom of COVID-19, that figure has undoubtedly increased. I decided to build this web app to help alleviate the burden doctors are currently facing with infected patients. I used Tensorflow and Keras along with datasets from Kaggle.com to build a machine learning model which can classify X-rays with 86% accuracy. I then used the Flask micro web framework to build a website where users can easily use the ML model. The deployed site can be found at https://pneumonia-detector-fs.herokuapp.com and a demo video can be found at youtube.com/watch?v=wL8UyZb2hJg.


UPDATE: Heroku has removed their free tier of service, I am currently working on deploying the model to Azure. You can still run the project by cloning and using the requirements.txt, however make sure to install opencv-python (requirements.txt only contains opencv-headless which is the module used for deployment)
